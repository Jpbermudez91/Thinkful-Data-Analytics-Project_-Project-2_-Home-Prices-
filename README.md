# Thinkful-Data-Analytics-Project_-Project-2_-Home-Prices-
This repository contains my portfolio of a project I worked on during my time at Thinkful. Working as a Data Analyst for the ficitional "Citi Fargo" bank, I was tasked to find what factors drove home prices. Using a dataset from Kaggle, I drafted several experiments showing the statistical signifigance of factors such as number of rooms and overall condition of homes sold. The Excel document contains several dynamic Pivot Tables and t-Test calculations along with an analysis. There is also a PP presentation of my findings.
